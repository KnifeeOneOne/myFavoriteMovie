## File Doc
### entertainment_center
This is a work file. I set the instance in this file and run some function from other 2 files. If you are familiar with C , this is the _main file_.

### media
This is a class file, where I define a Movie class to store the arguments, such as title, storyline, poster_image, etc.

### fresh_tomatoes
This is a file providing the function to transform the movie instance into HTML, so we can open it in the chrome.
Thanks to the Udacity teacher Kunal providing such a powerful function, so I can finish my project fast. But I also realize that I should know more about HTML.
